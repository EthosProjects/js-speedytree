# js-speedytree

## Credit

All credit goes to [octavetoast](https://github.com/octavetoast/) who created this [module](https://github.com/octavetoast/speedytree). All I did was rewrite in pure JavaScript because I was too stupid to read TypeScript

## Usage

```js
import { QuadTree } from 'js-speedytree';
```
